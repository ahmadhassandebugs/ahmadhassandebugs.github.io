Hey, thanks for stopping by! 👋

I am a fifth year Ph.D. student, advised by Prof. [Feng Qian](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~fengqian/index.html).

My interest lies at the intersection of systems, networking, and machine learning. I design and evaluate cross-layer systems that optimize user experience, network performance, and device energy efficiency. By bridging large-scale measurements and foundational research with real-world engineering, my work advances the design of intelligent, adaptive, and high-performance networked systems.

In recent years, I have had the privilege of working closely with Prof. [Zhi-Li Zhang](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~zhang089/) and Prof. [Z. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/). Earlier, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [LUMS](https://lums.edu.pk/), where I explored cellular networks and congestion control under the guidance of Prof. [Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/).

  <strong>🎓 Graduating Spring'26</strong> — I am open to full-time opportunities in industry.
