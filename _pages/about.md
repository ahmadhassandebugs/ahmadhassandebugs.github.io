I am a Ph.D. student in the [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) department at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I am fortunate enough to be advised by Prof. [Feng Qian](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~fengqian/index.html). Topics that intrigue me include, but are not limited to, Mobile Systems, ML for Systems, 5G Mobile Networking, Multimedia Systems, and Networked VR/MR. My current research highlights challenges faced by today's 4G/5G applications and argues for a cross-layer design to overcome these challenges. 
<!-- I have a strong background in system/network engineering and I am skilled in C++, C, Java, and Python programming. -->

<!-- In my spare time, I enjoy watching sports (mostly cricket, soccer, football, F1, and chess) and working out. -->

Since the last few years, I have been working closely with Prof. [Zhi-Li Zhang](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~zhang089/) and Prof. [Z. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/). Previously, I was an undergrduate student at the [Lahore University of Management Sciences](https://lums.edu.pk/) majoring in Computer Science, where I had a great time studying cellular networks and congestion control under the supervision of Prof. [Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/).
