I am a final year Ph.D. student in the [ECE](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) department at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I am fortunate enough to be advised by Prof. [Feng Qian](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~fengqian/index.html). Topics that intrigue me include, but are not limited to, Mobile Systems, ML for Systems, 5G Mobile Networking, Multimedia Systems, and Networked VR/MR. My current research highlights challenges faced by today's 4G/5G applications and argues for a cross-layer design to overcome these challenges. 

In recent years, I have had the privilege of working closely with Prof. [Zhi-Li Zhang](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~zhang089/) and Prof. [Z. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/). Earlier, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [LUMS](https://lums.edu.pk/), where I explored cellular networks and congestion control under the guidance of Prof. [Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/).

<span style="color:red;font-weight:600;font-style:italic">I am expected to graduate in Spring 2026 and am open to full-time opportunities in industry.</span>
